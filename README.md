# Island Rush 2.5

K2.5 is a rewritten and refactored K2

- Server Side Architecture, 100% server side checks

- Separated Frontend / Backend Directories & File Structure

- Optimized SQL Queries and Table Structures (minimized)

- Refactored Logic for Battles and other Game Rules

- Unified player games (No more spectator dependencies)

- Combined all board dependencies (load, client, ajax)

- DOM Caching and other efficient methods

INSTRUCTIONS

The main directory should be hosted on a network (Using apache, or some web hosting with php installed)
The hosting service should also point users to the home.php page upon arrival to the site.

A MySQL Server must also be running, the database needs to be initilized using the backend/sql/db_create.sql
Modify the backend/sql/db_create.sql to insert the games for each teacher / section (follow the example for 'm1a1'-'adolph')
Note: Password hashes are MD5.
This file should be run once to insert the games and create the database tables.

Modify the backend/db.php file to point to the MySQL server. (hostname = server address)

To begin playing, navigate to the homepage through the hosting service. (ex: www.island-rush.com)
Each game must be initialized by logging into the admin, and pressing the Game Reset button.
Each game must also be set to 'active' through the admin page (when ready for gameplay).

------------

For sandbox network deployment (your own equipment)
Recommend running XAMPP
This comes with Apache and MySQL servers
Load the repo into the htdocs folder generated by xampp
Change the configurations for apache to point to the home.php (may already be a default)
Use MySQL Workbench to connect to the localhost msql server running
Edit / Run the db_create script here. (put the games in)
Configure the backend/db.php to point to the localhost mysql server
Test by going to localhost on Chrome on the machine running XAMPP
Test by going to the machine's ip on the sandbox network (still through chrome) when on another computer
Play around by logging into the admin pages and clicking the 'reset-game' button (this puts initial pieces on the board)
Test logging into a game and moving pieces around, changing phases, other game mechanics...
Optional: Configure Apache to use custom DNS or set up custom DNS servers on the sandbox network (MaraDNS)
Optional: Configure Apache to use SSL certs for browsers to trust the site (may not be an issue on sandbox networks)

------------

For AZURE deployment
Recommend using a web-app
Use the deployment settings / slots to connect the web-app to the online repo (bitbutcket...etc)
Use Azure's settings to set up Custom Domains, SSL, Auto-Scaling, External Session Storage (recommended for this game)
Use Azure's MySQL server to host the database (this will come with it's own login, put this into db.php)
Use Azure's VM to connect to the database to run commands (this worked best for us, could alternatively set up fully external access)
All of these will (should) be on the same v-net to connect to each other
If issues occur with web-app, can always fall back to installing XAMPP (Apache) on the Azure VM and still use the external DB
Note: Azure provides simple dns records to connect (ex: islandrush.azurewebsites.net)

-------------
Basically:

- Files need to be hosted on a network (files = repository)
- Database accessible (use db_create) through that network (local or external)
- Have a good understanding of PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL and Networking (web-hosting)
