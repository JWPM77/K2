		<p>Troubleshooting when things go wrong...</p>
		<p>------------------</p>
		<!--		These were common problems found among sections, may need to update based upon certain deployment settings (different networks than EDU / MissionNet)       -->
		<p>
			Are you still connected to EDU or MissionNet (One may be more reliable
			than the other.)
		</p>
		<p>Are you using Chrome (other browsers may fail)</p>
		<p>Is it the right phase for what you're trying to do?</p>
		<p>
			What does the bottom user-feedback say? (This may clue to what is wrong)
		</p>
		<p>Is the action allowed by the rulebook (double check)</p>
		<p>
			If the island didn't capture, make sure you are using a land piece
			(helicopters don't count)
		</p>
		<p>
			If the island still didn't capture, move the piece onto the flag position
			again (same position, no moves taken) to try to update it.
		</p>
		<p>Did you try refreshing (almost always fixes things)</p>
		<p>
			Are you signed into the right team/section (check upper left menu to
			verify)
		</p>
		<p>------------------</p>
		<p>Tips / Other: (things people forget)</p>
		<p>------------------</p>
		<p>
			Drag and hold pieces over things to 'pop' them open (islands / carriers /
			transports)
		</p>
		<p>Planes must end turns on carriers / airfields. (or will be destroyed)</p>
		<p>
			Tankers refuel planes in their square 'on the transition' between combat
			phase and fortify phase.
		</p>
		<p>
			Defending planes (who were on a carrier) survive if their carrier is
			destroyed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Attacking planes only stay for 2 'rounds' of their 1 allowed combat, and
			then leave the combat zone.
		</p>
		<p>
			Destroyers can't be killed from defense bonus if they attack a piece on
			land (but they leave after 1 round)
		</p>
		<p>Always read the news alerts (they may affect the game in weird ways)</p>
		<p>
			Planes can only enter a battle if they are in the same square as what was
			selected (can't be adjacent)
		</p>
		<p>Hover the mouse over things to see details about them (like pieces)</p>
		<p>
			If you mistakenly make a move, use the undo-move button in the bottom left
			corner.
		</p>
