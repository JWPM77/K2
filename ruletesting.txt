List of things to test...

**Ensure user feedback for everything is accurate
**Ensure ajax for everything is accurate (Blue, Red, Spec)
    - Should all have the same functions...


phases
    - correct disabled buttons
    - no lag between phases (or note what has most lag)
    - points updated / other stuff updated
    - enabled / disabled stuff (purchasing, moving, undo)

pieces
    - moving into valid spots (title is updated correctly)
    - moving into invalid spots prevented (title is not updated)
        - wrong phase
        - wrong team's piece
        - out of moves
        - wrong terrain
        - distance > 1
        - All combinations for containers
        - All news alert preventions (airfield + nuke?)
    - undo move works correctly (prevents bad undo's)
        - right phase / stuff
        - into and out of containers
    - purchasing works
        - not enough points
        - trashing gives back points

hybrid
    - all hybrid options work
    - all options have lasting effect
        - bank drain
        - add move
        - etc...

battles
    - check who can do what when
    - buttons disabled / enabled correctly
    - dice roll is smooth
    - highlighting the pos correctly
    - refreshing during the gameSections

homepage
    - able to log into the game
    - able to see the rulebook

admin
    - login secure
    - able to switch news alerts
    - able to reset game
    - accurately see what admins need to see (current phase / stuff)

ajax (shouldn't really need to test this, client side uses ajax for game state changes)
    - see what is client side only for functions and the game.js

spectator
    - not allowed to do anything
    - gets all updates







airfields disabled for newsalerts
planes refueled correctly
planes deleted correctly
placements from reinforcements can go to only where they are allowed to go




Could re-compress / resize images for quicker transfer
    there are better image formats for better compression / quicker transfer (according to google site audit)

could minifi all frontend files (js / css)
    get rid of unused css
